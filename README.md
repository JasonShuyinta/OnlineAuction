# OnlineAuction (University of Bologna, IT)

GWT based project using MapDB as a persistent db

**OnlineAuction** is an online platform for making bids and offers in order to be able to either buy or sell an object in an auction.

The system is implemented using GWT. 

To get the system going, clone the repository and open it in any IDE, preferably Eclipse. 

Once done this step, navigate to the src directory, and just run it. On Eclipse IDE, in the development tab will appear an address pointing to your localhost. 

Click it and you're ready to go!
